           <p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a> says that you don&rsquo;t need a paintbrush to be an artist. Your tools can just as easily be a spreadsheet, a text editor, or a pipette. Art is an expression of your creativity, your passion, and your personality, regardless of the medium you use to convey it.</p>

<p>I love this definition. I wish it was taught in schools. Imagine kids figuring out how the Pythagorean theorem <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/recreational-math/vi-hart/vi-cool-stuff/v/what-was-up-with-pythagoras">works</a> instead of memorizing the formula. Or kids that don&rsquo;t ask &ldquo;when am I ever going to use this?&rdquo; because they have to spend time grappling with the <a href="http://reasoniamhere.com/2013/09/27/teach-ignorance">questions</a> before they are given the answers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/7421862-linchpin-are-you-indispensable">Here</a> are some of the jucier quotes from Seth&rsquo;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Indispensable-career-remarkable-ebook/dp/B00354Y9ZU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381186407&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=linchpin">Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?</a>. This is the kind of book that will make your highlighter run out of ink.</p>
