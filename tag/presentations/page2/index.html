<p>This past Thursday was the closing ceremony of the Awesome Presentations Workshop, a 5-week get together where we talked about how to give better presentations. The last session served as an opportunity for the people who attended the workshop to show what they had learned during the previous month. William was one of the people who presented, and he has generously agreed to let me showcase his final presentation, along with one he built before the workshop. They couldn&rsquo;t be more different.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Before we start playing <em>Spot the Differences</em>, let&rsquo;s place the game in its proper context. Slides (good or bad) are not what makes a presentation. <strong>A presentation happens when a presenter tells a story to an audience who understands it</strong>. If any of those components is not in place (presenter, story, audience, understanding), it&rsquo;s not a presentation. The slides are the visual accompaniment of the spoken track, and their purpose is to illustrate the main points of the story clearly and intuitively.</p>

<h2>Notice and ask why</h2>

<p>The key to creating effective visuals is noticing things and asking why they are there. What do you notice about this image? At first glance, it&rsquo;s a bunch of numbers and letters. Ok, what else? To make it more fun, don&rsquo;t scroll past the image until you notice at least five things.</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/7dc9e4b2-d90d-4ded-a885-571c413b4153.jpg" alt="The Measured Man"></p>

<p>The image comes from an <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/the-measured-man/309018/?single_page=true">article</a> in The Atlantic about the quantified self movement (hence the numbers). Here&rsquo;s what I see:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Measured Man</em> is in black and it spans three rows.</li>
<li>There are numbers in 4 different shades of grey, and they are all used in every row (except for the <em>Measured row</em>).</li>
<li>There is at least one red number in every row.</li>
<li>There is a 25 between <em>The Measured and Man</em>.</li>
<li>There is so little spacing between rows that the ascender of the <em>d</em> touches the base of the <em>T</em>.</li>
<li>Numbers, letters and whitespace have different widths but every row adds up to the same length.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why are all those things in this image? We can&rsquo;t evaluate how effective or ineffective something looks if we don&rsquo;t know what problem it&rsquo;s trying to solve. My guess is that the numbers and letters are spaced to make up a square, the rows are so close to each other to make the square look compact, the numbers are grey so they don&rsquo;t steal attention away from the title, they are also different shades of grey so they don&rsquo;t appear flat and uniform, the red draws attention to the numbers without stealing it from the title.</p>

<h2>Your cover slide just wants to be noticed</h2>

<p>The more things you notice, the more information you have about the problem, and the better decisions you can make to solve it. When we&rsquo;re building slides we think we know what we want them to look like, but we often don&rsquo;t take the time to answer the lurking why questions. Take a look at William&rsquo;s original cover slide. What do you notice? (You can also follow along with the actual <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nachocab/give-your-slides-a-makeover">slides</a>)</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/80753ecc-46d6-4e92-8dbb-0076f4c65787.jpg" alt="cover slide0"></p>

<p>I see a title in white, a red rectangle with rounded borders, a drop shadow, his name, the name of the university, a date and a curvy red-to-black gradient in the bottom. Those are perfectly valid visual elements. The question is <strong>why are those elements there?</strong> What is the purpose of this slide in the context of the story?</p>

<p>The main goal of a cover slide is to convince the audience that the presenter is going to tell a story worth listening to. There might be other goals—like showing your name and affiliation when your audience doesn&rsquo;t know who you are—but they are secondary to giving them a reason to drop their cell phones and listen to what you have to say. This is what William changed it to:</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/7a92b2b1-9989-42a6-8090-6a7ff0ba806d.jpg" alt="cover slide1"></p>

<p>Regardless of how little you know about heated gas-solid flows, that image is going to grab your attention. It&rsquo;s so memorable that <em>not</em> using it is almost a crime. Since it&rsquo;s symmetric, I centered the text and used another image from his presentation to solidify the connection between the word <em>heated</em> and the heated rod, but the improvements in clarity over William&rsquo;s version are marginal.</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/356b5f0e-d9fa-4f34-9b47-97e8dabe43dd.jpg" alt="cover slide2"></p>

<h2>Every tool has a bias</h2>

<p>PowerPoint makes it easy to create bullet points, a piece of paper makes it easy to scribble, LaTeX makes it easy to write equations, Keynote makes it easy to do product launch presentations. Every time a tool makes something easy, it&rsquo;s also making something else hard.</p>

<p>The LaTeX template that William used for his original slide made it very easy to add a progress header showing the current section, a title box with a red-to-black gradient and a drop shadow, red bullet points, and a two-color footer with his name, a mini-title and the slide number. All of these elements crowded what he really wanted to show, which was a schematic of the carbon capture simulation.</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/ae4f1104-2906-4b74-9e4b-e4e095096ea2.jpg" alt="carbon capture 0"></p>

<p>For his latest presentation, he skipped the LaTeX template and started with a blank slide. Then he added the image and a title.</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/ab648fbc-c8c6-43e9-8f32-a0804df5add1.jpg" alt="carbon capture 1"></p>

<p>Because he took the time to develop a story, he was able to skip the bullet points and describe the figure in a way that felt natural. However, the complexity of the schematic didn&rsquo;t really align with the flow of the story (which was tailored to a general audience), so an alternative could have been to point out the inputs and outputs of the simulator using a toy diagram, show the motivation of the project in the title, and maybe add a picture of the simulator. Something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/ee656f1a-4fc4-4fa5-92c0-0f1146196d88.jpg" alt="carbon capture 2"></p>

<h2>Visual summaries are easier to remember</h2>

<p>On the LaTeX presentation, William&rsquo;s summary slide was the same as the initial outline slide: bullet points listing each section of the presentation.</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/704b2dda-dd2e-423c-8b33-86448fd3fe72.jpg" alt="summary 0"></p>

<p>On the new presentation, William used the most important illustrations of his presentation to summarize the project. All three images had been previously shown in individual slides, so it was easy for the audience to recall the main idea behind each figure.</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/51fbb4a6-8f28-4078-8c1a-8dd75b37a114.jpg" alt="summary 1"></p>

<p>To make it even easier to digest, I added animations that made each figure appear one by one. I also removed the right-pointing arrows (since the figures appear in the same order as they do in the process), and I used the take-away as the new title instead of Recap.</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/1343784a-40f3-4b31-9ecd-f45220841f38.jpg" alt="summary 2"></p>

<p>Every design decision you make (or don&rsquo;t make) brings your design either closer to your goal or away from it. It&rsquo;s easier to get to where you want to be if you <strong>develop the habit of noticing the way things are</strong> and <strong>asking why those things are there</strong>. Practice with your latest presentation, what do you notice in each slide? What were your goals when you built them? How can you make them more memorable, cleaner, or easier to understand?</p>

        <p><p>Sheldon Cooper and Brian Greene are both theoretical physicists focusing on string theory. Besides the fact that Greene is an actual scientist and Sheldon just plays one on TV, they differ in one important aspect: Greene cares about his audience.</p>

<p>Compare Sheldon&rsquo;s condescending glare with Greene&rsquo;s radiating intent in the video below.</p>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/mpXQ8m_tmbs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Greene uses his epic simplifying skills to present a complex bit of Higgs Boson math in less than 3-minutes. It makes you want to stick around for the rest of the lecture. Why does an accomplished scientist care about helping others understand? I&rsquo;m sure that his ability to be understood by both colleagues and outsiders has had profound implications on his scientific career.</p>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KWj00MCqSxs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>You only need to watch the media coverage of scientific controversies to realize that dumbing down complex topics is easy. The hard part is simplifying them: pinpointing the confusing aspects and coming up with insights that help your audience traverse them. Every time you transform a hairy concept into an intuitive notion, your presentation&rsquo;s awesome level rachets up.</p>

<h2>Speak to the newbies</h2>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re giving the keynote at a conference or presenting at lab meeting. You always have a choice on who you will tailor your presentation to. Speaking to experts is easier because they share our mental shortcuts, but speaking to newbies gives us an opportunity to uncover the meaning behind our everyday lingo, and forces us to think about our project with a beginner&rsquo;s mind. Many scientific breakthroughs were born from seeing old problems from new perspectives.</p>

<p>So, next time you have to prepare a presentation, <strong>figure out who in your audience will know the least about your topic, and address them</strong>.</p>

<p>When you tailor your message to the people in the audience who are the least familiar with it, everybody wins. The newbies win because they&rsquo;re able to follow along, the experts win because you provide a good setup that helps them appreciate the punch line, and you win because you gain perspective that lets you understand your project more deeply.</p>

<p>Hello, the title of my talk is &ldquo;Modeling Barnacle-Induced Drag on Maritime Vessels Using Computational Fluid Dynamics-based Optimization.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start by giving you an introduction, then I&rsquo;ll talk about the results of my simulation, and then I&rsquo;ll talk about future work.</p>

<p>As you probably know, current antifoulant compounds are unable to prevent the marine propagule attachment. The coefficient that you see in Equation 1 is estimated to be blah, blah, blah&hellip;</p>

<p>The promise of a warm slice of pizza is probably the only thing keeping you in your seat at this point.</p>

<p>What if the presentation started out like this?</p>

<p><img src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/12333428d5b031183e4475c37/images/Slide2.jpg" alt="Long John Silver acting like a human"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You probably never thought about it, but the shipping industry spends 6 billions of dollars every year fighting mussels and barnacles.</p>

<p>One of the most surprising facts about these creatures is that a healthy colony of barnacles attached to the hull of an ocean liner can cause a drag of up to 60%.</p>

<p>It gets worse. To compensate for the decrease in speed, fuel consumption must go up by 40%, which increases costs and pollution.</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;m going to tell you about why this happens and what we can do to minimize it.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Given a choice between both presentations, most people would prefer to attend the second. So, why do we keep giving the first one?</p>

<p>The reason is fear.</p>

<p>We are afraid that if we edit out irrelevant details someone might ask to see them. We are afraid that if we make our content accessible it will be easier to criticize. We are afraid that if we break tradition we will seem unprofessional. So what do we do? We focus on the details, we hide behind the podium, and we bury the presentation that we really wanted to give. We don&rsquo;t want to be vulnerable, so the robot takes over.</p>

<p>One of my heroes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0">Brené Brown</a>, says we avoid being vulnerable because we don&rsquo;t want to seem weak. What we forget is that <strong>when we see vulnerability in others we call it courage, but when we see it in ourselves we call it weakness</strong>.</p>

<p>Fear keeps us from being vulnerable, but it also prevents us from connecting with the people in the audience. You can&rsquo;t be creative if you&rsquo;re not willing to be vulnerable. You can&rsquo;t innovate if you don&rsquo;t want to make mistakes. Next time you have to give a presentation, even if your results are not as sexy as you wanted them to be, even if the experiment didn&rsquo;t come out right, remember that you have a choice over who gets to tell your story: the robot or the human.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no story here. How did that guy lose his eye? What is that man inserting into that woman&rsquo;s face? Why would I need a surgically-implanted magnifying glass?</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>It even has an abstract that could have come out from any research article written today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;great care has been exercised in securing correctly designed instruments that we can positively guarantee to give suitable service on all occasions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>WAT?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that if you watch this video, you will still remember it a year from now (I&rsquo;m sure the other 4 million people who watched it would agree):</p>

<iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3iIkOi3srLo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Eyepatch guy missed the opportunity to tell his story because he thought that the important part was conveying facts. What follow-the-frog guy did differently was sharing an insight by building a narrative. If the power of story had been used more effectively in the 40s we might all be wearing eyepatches today.</p>

<p>Stories make it possible to communicate research findings in engaging and memorable ways (without losing any scientific rigor). Think of the last presentation you attended. If you only remember one thing, it&rsquo;s probably a story.</p>

<p>During graduate school we&rsquo;re too busy coming up with conference abstracts, designing posters, writing articles, and giving oral presentations to realize that these are just different ways of doing the same thing: telling a story.</p>

<p>So, how do we get better at it? You don&rsquo;t need any special effects or supernatural talents to tell a great story. All you need to do is change your perception about why you give presentations, and commit to getting better at the skills of communication.</p>

        <p><p>A talk is an opportunity to share an idea with your audience. If the audience gets lost, bored, or overwhelmed, the idea doesn&rsquo;t get shared. To give a great presentation you must condense the fog that surrounds your idea, craft a compelling narrative around it, illustrate it visually, and care enough to guide the audience every step of the way.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<h2>Condensing the fog that surrounds your idea</h2>

<p>You have either offered or been invited to give a talk. Maybe it&rsquo;s your weekly lab meeting, maybe it&rsquo;s your dissertation defense. Now, you face the challenge of putting yourself in the mental shoes of the people in your audience and figuring out what you are going to share with them.</p>

<p>This is <strong>hard</strong>. The mind of someone who is unfamiliar with your topic is unknown territory to you (although, ironically, it used to be you). If you are not willing to commit the time and emotional labor required to tell a story that your audience will be able to follow, you should not agree to give the talk.</p>

<p>Every creative process starts with a rough draft. Pianists improvise melody lines, illustrators doodle and sketch, and rappers freestyle. People that have to give presentations, unfortunately, open up PowerPoint. This is such an effective way of sabotaging your creativity that it should be illegal. Close that laptop lid, and grab a piece of <strong>paper</strong> instead.</p>

<p>Paper is an expressive medium, it makes failing cheap, and it encourages you to go crazy and try out new stuff. Fumbling with mouse cursors and text boxes conditions your brain to think that experimenting is expensive and unpleasant. Paper lets you triple underscore the stuff you like, and crumple up everything else. No guilt.</p>

<p>Start writing tentative titles, important concepts, supporting ideas, and the connections between them. Look out for natural ways to structure them, visualize them, and transition between them. The more you write, the more ideas you create. <strong>Forget criticism</strong> at this stage, you are just getting rid of the fog that clouds your main idea, and studying it from all possible angles.</p>

<p>Once you get started, you&rsquo;ll find it hard to stop. New strokes of insight will continue to trickle down unannounced, they will pop up when you&rsquo;re chopping onions, on your way to the gym, or in the middle of the night. Carry a notebook everywhere and write everything down.</p>

<h2>Crafting a compelling narrative</h2>

<p>Give yourself some pillow time before revisiting the ideas you collected. A clear head makes it easy to see which ones deflated overnight, and which ones are worth saving. You can let your ruthless editor come out now. Your brain needs time to switch from free-associating to critic mode. If you only give yourself 24 hours to prepare your presentation, you will undermine your ability to do good work.</p>

<p>Arrange the ideas that pass your initial filter into <strong>a word-for-word script that walks from title to conclusion</strong>. There is nothing like trying to explain something we think we understand, to realize that we really don&rsquo;t. As you write the script, you will run across awkward concepts that need rewording, unconnected ideas that need bridging, and unrelated topics that need pruning. Notice them and fix them.</p>

<p>Alongside the script, draw Post-It-sized mock-ups of what your tentative slides will look like. Don&rsquo;t fret the visual details (there will be time for that later), focus on making the script crisp and natural. It should sound like the way you speak.</p>

<p>Once you are happy with the script, take a moment to revisit the transitions you are using to move your story along. When moving from one slide to the next, you will sometimes be tempted to interrupt the narrative:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and this is just a plot of concentration versus yield&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of giving the impression that the slide caught you by surprise, prepare a transition that verbalizes the connection with what you said previously. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;and this led us to wonder the effects that changing the concentration would have on our experiment. We repeated it multiple times and saw that an increase in concentration produces a linear decrease in yield.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Treating the graph like it is a track running parallel to the main script makes it easier to follow along. It&rsquo;s also more satisfying for the audience; instead of simply hearing the punch line, they can build the connection between what they are seeing and what you are saying.</p>

<p>Every time you add something to the script ask yourself: <strong>is this helping my audience understand?</strong> For example, you might consider adding an outline slide, but think about it: 99% of presentations follow the same <em>intro-meat-conclusions</em> structure, you don&rsquo;t need to spend any time explaining it. On the other hand, you might consider splitting a non-trivial graph into two slides—one explaining the axes, another revealing the data. This is very likely to help your audience understand the significance of the graph. Do it.</p>

<h2>Illustrating ideas visually</h2>

<p>A good narrative is enough to effectively convey most ideas, but images can also provide additional layers of meaning that complement and clarify the original words. The combination of words and images is always more memorable than words alone. Think about what you remember from the last presentation you attended. It&rsquo;s probably not the words.</p>

<p>The two previous stages helped you identify the most important aspects of your initial idea, and arrange them in a logical narrative. You might even have accompanying figures for most of the script (if that&rsquo;s not the case, go back to paper; digitizing images is a painful way of experimenting). Now it&rsquo;s time to open up your favorite presentation software (unless you&rsquo;re giving a chalk talk).</p>

<p>PowerPoint and Keynote come loaded with default options that were not designed to meet your goals. If your notes have big white letters on a black background, don&rsquo;t settle for the small black-on-white text that PowerPoint will give you by default. If your thumbnails show full-page illustrations, don&rsquo;t let Keynote shrink your images when you drag them in, resize them. You know better than your tools.</p>

<p>When coming up with a title for your presentation, remember that talks and scientific articles have different goals. Articles tend to have long descriptive titles so they can be discovered through casual glances and keyword searches. Presentation titles are closer to advertising, their goal is not thoroughness, but maximizing the chances that a distracted conference attendee will close her laptop lid and lean in to hear what you have to say. Choose something that you would want to pay attention to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s natural for people to get distracted. To anchor their attention you can come up with <strong>titles for each slide</strong> (they also serve as reminders for you, in case you forget your next point). Full sentences trump short labels. For example, if you are showing a plot that represents the differences between two methods, and you title the slide with &ldquo;Method A vs. method B,&rdquo; someone that got distracted might miss the point. A full sentence like &ldquo;Method A reports smaller fold changes than method B&rdquo; will help them get back on track.</p>

<p>There is a guy sitting at the back of the room who wishes everything about your presentation were bigger. Make the text as large as you can get away with. Blow up your images to cover the entire slide. You never want to have to say &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t really see it here, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<span class="caption">Don&rsquo;t just show an image, showcase it.</span></p>

<h2>Guiding the audience along the way</h2>

<p>You have your idea, you have your story, and you have your slide deck. Time to start rehearsing.</p>

<p>Go through the entire presentation out loud, get a feel for the words, notice which ones feel natural and which ones seem awkward. Pay attention to sections that make you stumble, your audience will probably find them difficult as well. Pave the way for them (and for yourself) by rewriting the script and simplifying the slides.</p>

<p>When you rehearse the presentation for the second time, avoid looking at the slides or the script. You should have them almost memorized by now, which means that you can practice your talk during your morning run, or on the way to the grocery store. Also, when the time comes to give the actual presentation, you will be less tempted to turn your back to the audience, and you&rsquo;ll have an easier time looking at them in the eye.</p>

<p>What about <strong>fear</strong>? Fear creeps in when you imagine yourself standing in front of an actual audience. It is the mechanism used by your lizard brain to warn you of imminent danger. You should acknowledge it, and push on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hi Fear,</p>

<p>Thank you for showing up. I am going to give my talk now. In five minutes you will accept the fact that I&rsquo;m not going to run away, and you will stop complaining.</p>

<p>I hope next time it only takes you four minutes to realize that my life is not in danger.</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>Nacho</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The more speaking opportunities you seek out, the more exposure you will gain, the greater control you will have over your fear. You always look 90% less nervous than you actually feel (ask your friends, they&rsquo;ll back that up).</p>

<h2>Is investing so much effort worth it?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to you. The amount of effort you invest will depend on your goal. Presenting all the work you have done takes less time than helping your audience understand an idea. Choosing to focus on the latter will make you notice things like axes labels that are too small, or crowded slides that need splitting. Nobody is going to force you to do these things. You either care or you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>You might consider that three or four days of emotional labor are overkill for a lab meeting presentation, but probably worth it when giving the opening keynote at a conference. When you are running, your body doesn&rsquo;t care if you are on a treadmill or being chased by a lion; it ends up getting better at running. Likewise, when you are doing the work to prepare a presentation, your brain doesn&rsquo;t care how many people will be in the audience or how high the stakes are; it ends up getting better at doing the work.</p>

<p>Seek out every opportunity to get better at doing the work.</p>

<p>Designing presentations on paper lets you apply a magnifying glass of common sense to the logical flow of your ideas, making your inconsistencies go up in flames, like tiny ants.</p>

<p>If you are excited about what you are going to present that you don&rsquo;t know where to start, picking up a paper will help you sort through the jumble of thoughts running around your head and hone in those that can tell your story most effectively.</p>

<p>Avoid the impulse to start with Powerpoint and give your ideas a chance to fight it out and compete for your attention on paper. Doodling prevents early weak ideas from taking the place of more clever ideas that needed a bit more time to pop the surface of your subconscious.</p>

<p>Next time you have to give a presentation, draw it out on paper first. Use as many emphatic curvy arrows and triple underscores as you want.</p>
