<p>Non-native French speakers like myself have a hard time grappling with the French spelling system. It may seem arbitrary to write <strong>seconde</strong> and pronounce it <strong>segond</strong>, or frustrating that there is no rule to define why <strong>déçu</strong> has an accent on the <strong>e</strong>, but <strong>reçu</strong> doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>C&#39;est la vie, mon ami.— say the French</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I live in French Guiana, I am trying to come up with strategies to make these words easier to learn.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<h2>Focus on the most common words</h2>

<p>Dictionaries sort words by alphabetical order, which is convenient if you are looking for a definition, but masochistic if you are trying to figure out which words are the important ones.</p>

<p>One way is to sort them by frequency of usage. You take a bunch of French text and you count how many times each words appears, then you sort them by their frequency. Common words like <strong>de</strong>, <strong>je</strong> and <strong>le</strong> appear at the very top, and words like <strong>macarron</strong>, <strong>compétiteur</strong> and an <strong>antisportif</strong> show up at the bottom.</p>

<p>You have to do some trickery to combine words that share the same stem (for example: <strong>enchanté</strong>, <strong>enchantée</strong>, <strong>enchantés</strong> and <strong>enchantées</strong>) so they all add up as the same word, but it&rsquo;s manageable. <a href="https://github.com/nachocab/french_experiments/blob/master/fr_frequency_stems.txt">Here</a> is my quick-and-dirty attempt to sort French words based on their usage (the file has four columns: stem, frequency, the most common word with that stem, that word without any accents (I use this column to play a <a href="https://github.com/nachocab/french_experiments/blob/master/play">guessing game</a>)).</p>

<p>Once you have that file, you can start enjoying some seriously fun language-geekery.</p>

<h2>Finding patterns amid the French chaos</h2>

<p>The White Whale of French accents has to be the <strong>é</strong>. Every French student knows that the <strong>participe passé</strong> of -er verbs like <strong>chanter</strong> ends in é (<strong>chanté</strong>), but what are the rules governing words like <strong>préféré</strong>, <strong>élève</strong>, or <strong>fréquence</strong>?</p>

<p>Some <a href="http://orthonet.sdv.fr/pages/informations_p6.html">sites</a> can tell you the multiple spelling rules with their corresponding multiple exceptions, but they are not very helpful because our brains are not wired to deal with detailed rules and exceptions. Besides, native French speakers don&rsquo;t study these rules. What we excel at is association and intuition. It&rsquo;s much easier to memorize the lyrics of a song than 100 random words.</p>

<h2>Divide and conquer</h2>

<p>I have always wanted to know if I should accent words that begin with <strong>e</strong>. In the past, I grabbed my <em>Petit Robert</em> and tried making a list of words that began with <strong>é</strong> and another of words that began with <strong>e</strong>. I then promptly went on to forget everything from both lists.</p>

<p>A better approach is to focus on a few common words each day and reverse engineer the spelling rules. To add another layer of association, you can group them by type of word: words that begin with <strong>é</strong>, words that contain two <strong>é</strong>s separated by a consonant, words that have an <strong>é</strong> in the second position. Pick whatever you are having trouble with.</p>

<h2>Focus on the exceptions: words that begin with é</h2>

<p>For example, I can use <a href="http://reasoniamhere.com/2013/09/16/awk-gtf-how-to-analyze-a-transcriptome-like-a-pro-part-1/">AWK</a> to grab all the words that start with either <strong>é</strong> or <strong>e</strong> and show their frequency:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">awk <span class="s1">&#39;$3 ~ &quot;^é&quot; &amp;&amp; $2 &gt; 500 {print $2, $3}&#39;</span> fr_frequency_stems.txt

<span class="m">170230</span> était
<span class="m">28392</span> écoute
<span class="m">12778</span> étrange
<span class="m">12660</span> école
<span class="m">10824</span> équipe
...
<span class="m">561</span> élite
<span class="m">543</span> épingle
<span class="m">538</span> éclaté
<span class="m">518</span> épicerie
<span class="m">501</span> écureuil
</code></pre></div>
<p>In total, there are 123 words, but they are not all equally important: <strong>école</strong> is 25 times more common than <strong>épicerie</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see what words that start with <strong>e</strong> look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">awk <span class="s1">&#39;$3 ~ &quot;^e&quot; &amp;&amp; $2 &gt; 500 {print $2, $3}&#39;</span> fr_frequency_stems.txt

<span class="m">69775</span> encore
<span class="m">50094</span> entendu
<span class="m">42068</span> enfants
<span class="m">27877</span> entre
<span class="m">25380</span> elles
...
<span class="m">528</span> effraie
<span class="m">519</span> endommagé
<span class="m">509</span> edgar
<span class="m">508</span> estimé
<span class="m">506</span> endurer
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are around 200 commonly-used words that start with <strong>e</strong>. If we compare both lists we can see that no word that starts with <strong>é</strong> is followed by an <strong>x</strong>, an <strong>s</strong>, or a double consonant (<strong>ll</strong>, <strong>rr</strong>, <strong>ff</strong>).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">awk <span class="s1">&#39;$3 ~ &quot;^é[xs]|^é(ll|rr|ff)&quot; &amp;&amp; $2 &gt; 500 {print $2, $3}&#39;</span> fr_frequency_stems.txt <span class="p">|</span> wc -l

<span class="m">0</span> <span class="c"># extra essai ellipse erreur effacer ...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can also see that words that start with <strong>e</strong> seem to be followed by <strong>n</strong> or <strong>m</strong>, and that only a handful of words break this rule:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">awk <span class="s1">&#39;$3 ~ &quot;^e[nm]&quot; &amp;&amp; $2 &gt; 500 {print $2, $3}&#39;</span> fr_frequency_stems.txt <span class="p">|</span> wc -l
<span class="m">108</span> <span class="c"># ex: entendu enfants entre ensemble endroit ...</span>
...

awk <span class="s1">&#39;$3 ~ &quot;^é[nm]&quot; &amp;&amp; $2 &gt; 500 {print $2, $3}&#39;</span> fr_frequency_stems.txt

<span class="m">3661</span> énorme
<span class="m">3193</span> énergie
<span class="m">2474</span> énerve
<span class="m">2344</span> émission
<span class="m">2229</span> émotions
</code></pre></div>
<p>The words that break the <strong>n/m</strong> rule contain an <strong>é</strong> that is pronounced by itself (it forms its own syllable), unlike the rest of <em>en/em</em> words. You should focus your memorization efforts on these outcasts and assume that the remaining words follow the rule.</p>

<h2>Guess wisely: words with é in the second position</h2>

<p>We can use a similar approach to look at words that have <strong>é</strong> in the second position:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">awk <span class="s1">&#39;$3 ~ &quot;^.é&quot; &amp;&amp; $2 &gt; 500 {print $3}&#39;</span> fr_frequency_stems.txt <span class="p">|</span> cut -c2 <span class="p">|</span> sort <span class="p">|</span> uniq -c <span class="p">|</span> sort -k1,1gr
    <span class="m">113</span> dé
     <span class="m">64</span> ré
     <span class="m">19</span> mé
     <span class="m">16</span> sé
     <span class="m">15</span> pé
     <span class="m">10</span> hé
      <span class="m">9</span> lé
      <span class="m">8</span> gé
      <span class="m">8</span> né
      <span class="m">7</span> bé
      <span class="m">7</span> té
      <span class="m">7</span> vé
      <span class="m">6</span> cé
      <span class="m">6</span> fé
</code></pre></div>
<p>Holy Molly! This breakdown shows that words that begin with <strong>dé</strong> or <strong>ré</strong> make up 60% of the common words that have é in the second position ((113 + 64) / 300). Let&rsquo;s focus on those two.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">awk <span class="s1">&#39;$3 ~ &quot;^de&quot; &amp;&amp; $2 &gt; 500 {print $3}&#39;</span> fr_frequency_stems.txt <span class="p">|</span> wc -l
62

awk <span class="s1">&#39;$3 ~ &quot;^re&quot; &amp;&amp; $2 &gt; 500 {print $3}&#39;</span> fr_frequency_stems.txt <span class="p">|</span> wc -l
152
</code></pre></div>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s interesting. There are twice as many <strong>dé</strong> words than <strong>de</strong> words, but there are twice as many <strong>re</strong> words as there are <strong>ré</strong> words. This means that if you are not sure how to accent a word you should guess <strong>dé</strong> and <strong>re</strong>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any obvious rules that we can follow to determine if these words should have <strong>é</strong> or <strong>e</strong>, so we will have to come up with our own associations.</p>

<p>For example, memorizing words that look alike is easier if we focus on their differences rather than if we learn them independently:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>début - debout</p>

<p>désert - dessert</p>

<p>démarrer - demander</p>

<p>détruire - destruction</p>

<p>déssigner - design</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also make up memorable stories:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>La secrétaire a gardé l&#39;accent de secret</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are hundreds of little tricks but this post has gone on long enough. I hope this approach makes your studying more effective. Let me know how it goes and share your own strategies in the comments.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Regarding a few comments on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1qw1a6/a_hackers_approach_to_understanding_french/">Reddit</a> The diacritics are there to change the pronunciation, but non-native speakers don&rsquo;t always know if a word should be pronounced é or e. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m Spanish, but I&rsquo;m tempted to want to say <strong>sécret</strong> (just like <strong>sécurité</strong>) instead of <strong>secret</strong>. If I know how <strong>secret</strong> is written, I can make an effort to pronounce it properly; other times I will use my knowledge of how it&rsquo;s pronounced to write it properly. It&rsquo;s a two-prong approach.</p>
