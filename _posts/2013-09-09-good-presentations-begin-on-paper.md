Designing presentations on paper lets you apply a magnifying glass of common sense to the logical flow of your ideas, making your inconsistencies go up in flames, like tiny ants.

If you are excited about what you are going to present that you don't know where to start, picking up a paper will help you sort through the jumble of thoughts running around your head and hone in those that can best tell your story.

Avoid the impulse to start with Powerpoint and give your ideas a chance to fight it out and compete for your attention. Doodling on paper prevents early weak ideas from taking the place of more clever ideas that needed a bit more time to pop the barrier of your subconscious.

I hope you catch yourself drawing emphatic curvy arrows and triple underscores next time you have an eureka moment.

Here are some of the scribbles I drew while brainstorming old presentations, along with the digital version they eventually became.
