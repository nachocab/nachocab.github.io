"No cilantro, please"
Yet I know when it arrives
It will be present</pre>

The first time I tried cilantro I didn't realize it; I just thought somebody had emptied a bottle of Old Spice on my pizza in an attempt to poison me. Cilantro tastes like soap to approximately 10% of the people who have had their genotype analyzed by [23andMe](http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/2044-7248-1-22.pdf). The currently accepted explanation is that those of us who passionately despise cilantro were born with a genetic variant called a **single-nucleotide polymorphism** (or SNP).

<!--excerpt-->

A location of the genome is said to contain a SNP when a significant fraction of the population has a specific nucleotide in that location (either A, C, G, or T), and the remaining population has a different one. The cilantro SNP is called [rs72921001](http://snpedia.com/index.php/Rs72921001), and apparently, its genomic location lays close to a cluster of olfactory receptor genes that includes OR6A2, the gene most likely to be alerting our brain about the presence of cilantro.

<span class="caption">What an olfactory receptor looks like. Notice the red compound binding to it in the middle</span>

The OR6A2 receptor has high binding specificity for several of the [aldehydes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldehyde) contained in cilantro. When these molecules enter the nose, they come into contact with the olfactory sensory neurons located in the upper region of the nasal cavity. Each of these cells expresses only one odorant receptor, and when the right chemical binds to the right receptor, an electrical signal is sent upwards—through the bone—to the olfactory bulb, where it is further relayed by other cells until it reaches the olfactory cortex region of the brain.

The nucleotide that you have in the location of the rs72921001 SNP is thought to influence how the OR6A2 receptor perceives the presence of cilantro. If you are among the 10% of humans who have a C instead of an A in that location, when confronted with cilantro, instead of the misleading "Gee, I smell cilantro, lalala, happiness" your brain will warn you of the real danger coming your way: "I smell the disgusting herb that poisons everything that is good and loveworthy in the world. Run for your life!" Now you know why.
