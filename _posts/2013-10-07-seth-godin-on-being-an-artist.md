[Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) says that you don't need a paintbrush to be an artist. Your tools can just as easily be a spreadsheet, a text editor, or a pipette. Art is an expression of your creativity, your passion, and your personality, regardless of the medium you use to convey it.

I love this definition. I wish it was taught in schools. Imagine kids figuring out how the Pythagorean theorem [works](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/recreational-math/vi-hart/vi-cool-stuff/v/what-was-up-with-pythagoras) instead of memorizing the formula. Or kids that don't ask "when am I ever going to use this?" because they have to spend time grappling with the [questions](http://reasoniamhere.com/2013/09/27/teach-ignorance) before they are given the answers.

[Here](http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/7421862-linchpin-are-you-indispensable) are some of the jucier quotes from Seth's book [Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?](http://www.amazon.com/Linchpin-Indispensable-career-remarkable-ebook/dp/B00354Y9ZU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1381186407&sr=1-1&keywords=linchpin). This is the kind of book that will make your highlighter run out of ink.
