You enter the conference room. Your fellow attendees are holding a slice of pizza with one hand, and typing on their laptops with the other. You're hoping this *attendance-required* presentation won't be like the previous one. You wish the hour you are about to invest is worth it. You skip the pizza and you sit down with a notepad in your lap.

The projector is showing the first slide: *Using Gene Expression Profiles During Early Zygotic Transcription to Characterize the Biophysical Mechanism of Evolutionary Attractors*. You are not entirely sure what that means, but you recognize a few of the words, and you have not yet ready to abandon the idea that this *could* be worth it. You still believe that every speaker has something interesting to say, and the ability to share it in a way that makes it easy to understand and remember.

> Hello, the topic of this talk is using gene expression profiles during early zygotic transcription to characterize the biophysical mechanism of evolutionary attractors.

As the speaker reads the title off the screen, you wonder if he realized that choosing such an unrememberable title would force him to read it and break eye-contact with the audience two seconds after introducing himself.

> Uhm, so, this is the outline of my talk: first we'll cover a general introduction of the topic; then we will look at some of the methods we used, the results we had; and finally, I want to end by talking about the future directions of my research.

You are two minutes in, and not any closer to understanding what the talk is about. The fact that the speaker started with an outline breaks your hopes that this presentation will be bullet-point free. Nobody reads the index before diving into a novel, they trust the author's choice of structure. A conventional outline misses the opportunity to grab the attention of the audience when it is at its peak. A memorable image would have been a better choice.

> Here you can see that our approach is equivalent to shrinking the estimated sample variance of sigma; and here we are reformulating the problem in terms of the posterior probability of omega, which is nothing more than a derived hyperparameter of the model you see here.

You realize this presentation isn't about an idea, it's about a slide deck. Instead of leaving a trail of breadcrumbs between concepts, the speaker worried about describing small patches of the forest in detail, and omitted the mental map that interconnected them. Most of the people in the room are now staring down at their laptops.

The presentation is over. You clap along with everyone else, thanking the speaker for his effort, but you know you won't be able to recall a single word in two weeks. Your notepad is empty, and once again, you wonder what would have happened if instead of a giving a presentation, the speaker had told you an interesting story.
