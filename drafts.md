post about 30 day challenges
no matter how small or big the challenge you will hear these voices in your head
* this is stupid
* it's not worth it
* nothing will happen if i miss one day
* why am i doing this
* i want out

the only thing that will stop you is the fear of public humiliation by breaking your word

where you lack discipline, you need to add structure

* you need to add more links on the sides of your page, and a reason to subscribe (look at seanwes.com)
* you need to add tables of contents with links
* you need summaries at the end of your posts

## post about what it takes to present (12 hours to write + 14:30-)

Every time you come up with a mental bridge to cross a difficult concept your thumbnails will expand, merge, divide, or disappear. This construction effort ensures that everyone in your audience will make it to the end alive. And awake.

By taking the time to flesh out your ideas on paper you have dramatically reduced the chances that your slides will be full of uninspired bullet points and unnecessary gradients. However, there are still traps lurking inside PowerPoint and Keynote (choose which one to use based on personal preference, neither should make a significant difference).

Caring will not be part of your job description. You won't find a step-by-step guide to make your ideas understood by others. To get better, you have to decide that improving is worth the effort.


get better at sharing your ideas, it will make your audience more engaged, and your content more memorable.


A presentation is an opportunity to share an idea with your audience.

Neatness and perfection are irrelevant at this stage.

Just because you generated an image while you were doing your analysis doesn't mean you should show it. Explaining things to yourself, or to experts, is different from explaining them to people that are unfamiliar with your topic. It might take guts to prioritize what images are worth showing, surely not all the images that you generated

Or rather, the main idea, and all its supporting ideas. If you find that multiple ideas are competing for the star role, now is the right time to re-assess the reason why you are giving the talk. What is the message you want to convey? One talk, one message.

This stage is all about providing focus and clarity.


I would love to hear your comments about this post.

Scientific Presentations



It is a platform for collecting,
progressively giving them shape
where the moments of insight happen,

 there are no constraints, you can go from thought to rough sketch instantly, you can focus on the entire page or on a small section, you can highlight, underscore, emphasize, draw arrows, circles and boxes at will, you can shade, color, erase, redraw and doodle, corral, baloon and gradually build a mental map that only you can decifer, you can watch your ideas take shape from awkward botchy concepts to streamlined flows, you can identify story gaps and logical flaws and cover them up, you can

 build bridges scross narrative gaps story
 and logical flows will pop up at you like nasty witch-moles.

A presentation is not a peer-reviewed article, clarity trumps rigour,

What other concepts is your idea tied to, how does it feel to articulate it what are the aspects that attract you most, after you give them a chance to compete for your attention, how do you feel a few hours or a day later,

which concepts won, which concepts need repairing.

When you are beginning to think about presenting an idea, it is like a fog. You must condense the idea fog into individual droplets.





Painting yourself into a corner is actually good in this case.

would like to know more about (having to write about it gives you an excuse to do the research)

## What did I blog about?

I had a discussion with some friends over lunch about what is the point of Twitter, so I wrote a [post] afterwards, talks I watch, ideas I come across, tools I'm passionate about. Sciency stuff that I thought was cool, writing,

I scrounged/scrambled for content, always keep a notebook nearby.
some topics don't promise to go anywhere, but when i start writing they work, and the reverse is also true.write about whatever you find interesting, make this decision on a line-by-line basis. your initial idea will often change

It's all about giving it your worst shot to avoid perfectionism paralysis, and then going for incremental improvement.

If i don't write them down they drift, I forget

It will require effort and emotional labor. If you are not willing to go through, that's okay. But then, you shouldn't give the talk.

It's easier to remain within your current state of mind (the mindset you had before you were introduced to the topic is now long forgotten).

It's easier to rush to the punch line than to build anticipation. Comedians know this, storytellers know this, so should we.

ensures that you will have a clear idea about the figures that are most effective at reinforcing your message. Taking the reverse approach—starting with figures you previously generated and adapting your script around them—, means that you will pay less attention to the bridges that your audience needs to follow along.

The key to avoiding template gimmicks and uninspired layouts is to face your presentation software with clear ideas about what your slides should look like.



You invested time and emotional energy into designing slides that meet a specific goal. Don't let your tools lead you elsewhere. (Choosing between Keynote and PowerPoint is a matter of personal preference, it won't have a significant impact over the end result.)




## So, was it worth it?

Hells, yeah. I proved to myself that I could do it, I had the high after writing each post, which is 10 times more satisfying than clearing your email inbox. I'll keep blogging although at a more relaxed pace. I want to use the power of the 30-day challenge to finish some of the other stuff I was never able to stick to, like drawing, I always wanted to learn how to draw, but I never "found the time". Now I know that [outsourcing the decision to get started] is the only way to overcome the instinct to procrastinate.  will be drawing

Choose your own challenge. It doesn't have to be blogging, it could be learning a foreign language, going to the gym, painting. Ideally each day's work will end with a finished product: a post, a sketch, a workout. Something you can show people to know if you kept true to your word.

I didn't know that I had these posts in my brain.







the feeling after you write a post


Matt Cuts and his 30 day challenges


* leaves me wanting to do more 30-day challenges: drawing, reading papers (maybe, a paper a week, one/two days to read it; one/two days to write about it)



write about the most interesting thing you can come up with at the time (even if it is not that interesting)


## Don't worry about criticism

how many people read you

Looking at Google Analytics is masochistic, especially at the early stages. Every successful blog author cringes at the posts they wrote during the first year. You can create better content if you leave the drama of what others think out of the equation. If your goal is to become a better writer, write. If you keep at it, your writing will become good enough to make your friends want to tell *their* friends about it. But this is beyond your control, the only thing you should worry about is how to provide more value to your readers. It's a slippery slope, you write for others, but you can't rely on other people's opinion, just keep writing.


the more you write, the easier it is to see what works and what doesn't. Ask for feedback.



The Internet didn't happen

 and are instead willing to share their work with others and be critized for it.

 You have the choice to work on stuff that matters or not. It's staggering how often we let others make the choice for us.

We need more artists.

Artists are not replaceable. If you stick to doing what you're told, somebody else will do it cheaper than you.


That's what makes them valueable.

Staying within your comfort zone.

Every day, I'm afraid that I won't have anything to write about, instead of running away I use it to fuel me, I hustle to come up with a topic and edit it until I'm satisfied.







Artists fail all the time.

They don't need maps, they use a compass. Picasso failed all the time. Art is any work for which there is no instruction.

No maps => that's what makes it valueable.

Doing work for which there is no job description. If your employer knows exactly what they want, you are replaceable.

Artists are not replaceable. Every kid wants to be an artist. The world doesn't have enough non-easily-replaceable people. People working on stuff that matters, we don't have enough. Getting more followers is easy, getting more leaders is hard.

Nobody made you work on stuff that doesn't matter. Nobody told you that you needn't care about your job.

Dear first-grade teacher,

My mom told me that you think I can't draw because the people in my drawings have wings instead of hands. They are supposed to look like that! You obviously don't get it

Back in First Grade, you scolded me for drawing people with hands that looked like wings. You thought it was so bad, that you even told my mom about it: "Your son draws wings instead of hands". To this day

My third-grade teacher scolded me for drawing people with wings instead of hands.

Seth Godin



I know you were just doing your job, but you made me feel like I was inadequate. You are the first memory I have of someone telling me I wasn't good enough.

Some time has passed and listening people like Seth Godin speak, I've come to grips. You were not the only one who told me I wasn't good enough. You were probably also told that you weren't good enough. That's okay, life is different now. There is no longer a need for peons. You can stop now. We have all the followers we need, thank you.

I would suggest you focus on inspiring your

I was one of the lucky ones.

This model explains why a suffocating majority of bioinformatic papers are just a bunch of lists: lists of genes, lists of interactions, lists of p-values, but no explanations.

It is almost impossible to interact with someone who works on a different field without speaking the same language.

The datasets typically generated at the bench are smaller than the lists that computers, butBiologists might have smaller datasets, but they are working on real problems

Bioinformatics is full of really smart people working on unimportant problems.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's all about the stories that we tell ourselves. What movie is playing in the background. Self-talk, self-conversation

All of this is self-control: these are tips for self control, short term, eventually you are no longer tempted by Doritos, eventually you finish the paper, eventually you go to the gym.

But what makes you gritty is keeping at it for the long haul. The gym is a great example. What do you do when the stakes are not high: a paper is due, a speech. Now there is no deadline, it's a highly desireable long goal, but there is no impending checkpoint. Stuff like losing weight, getting better at writing, at dancing, or at playing an instrument.

For these things you need a story: an overarching theme that is the epic reason that compels you to finishing your daily writing quota, grabbing the gym bag on a rainy day, or working on that impossible guitar lick one bar at a time.

How to adopt a Nike mentality and just doing it. Who wouldn't want to become a master of tricking our brains into doing what we ultimately want. How to trick your brain:

It's not about blowing the audience away, it's about sharing an idea.



How to adopt a Nike mentality and just doing it

shift expectations, the choice to spend time working on your goal is not your choice (you from the past made that choice and set up clear time limits, you must follow it or face direr consequences), detach from outcome (don't stop working on it before you get good, Seth Godin talks about the dip).

You need a track record of successes: redefine success => not as set by society, not balanced on society's expecataions, but your own

you to finishing your daily writing quota, grabbing the gym bag on a rainy day, or working on that impossible guitar lick one bar at a time.

easy when the stakes are high (speech, etc.), what do you do when the stakes are not high.




You need a narrative.

, not having a best seller doesn't mean you are not a good writer, not having a first-author Science paper doesn't mean you are not a good scientist. I'd be willing to bet that there are more gritty scientists with Nature papers.

How do you set up the narrative. We can engineer artificial urgency into our brains. It's still an open question what makes a narrative work: make it bigger than yourself (saving humanity), make it about something else (I may not believe that the world needs me to become a better writer, but I do believe that if I don't post today I will be openly shamed in my facebook wall). Please go ahead and drop me an [email](mailto:nachocab@gmail.com) if you have any strong opinions about what makes a good narrative.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

stuff that scares us
stuff that we think we need
stuff that we think it is too hard

The main reason why people give speeches is because they don't have to make the decision to speak, they are invited to give a talk, the "deadline" is clear

Gyms could hire chauffeurs that pick up their clients and drag them out of bed, but then they wouldn't make as much money. Most people wouldn't cancel their subscriptions, but skipping a few days, eventually turns into skipping a week, then a month. Then never showing up again.

Awesome hypothesis can be generated using computational tools, but by handing off our data for somebody else to validate we are missing out on troves of interesting research directions.

For example, say you predict that a protein interacts with a region of DNA. If somebody else designs the experiment to validate the interaction you are signing off on the possibility that the familiarity that you gained from performing the analysis will improve the design and the execution of the experiment; the same applies to the experimentalist with an interesting finding that gives the data away for someone else to analyze, it reduces the possibility that an important part of the analysis will be missed because the relevant piece of biological knowledge was not shared.

Working on important problems requires as much effort as working on unimportant ones

There is another set of much more interesting problems that cannot be asked (let alone, solved) without being proficient at both fields.





We think of experimental validation as something that lays just beyond our area of inquiry. We predict all the microRNA-target mRNA interactions, and you, experimental people, validate them.

There is a set of problems that can be solved following the traditional pipeline: we analyze a ton of data, and hand off a list to the experimentalists—unfortunately, we rarely bother to find out what they think of our lists.


If you spend any time listening to what other scientists think of bioinformatics, you will quickly hear
.

not knowing what's possible, no encouragement to go out and learn what's possible. If you don't know what's possible, you won't ever make an unexpected connection because you lack the context.

Should be seeking exposure like crazy.

Bigger and more complex datasets

Datasets are only getting bigger and more complex, there is no doubt of the importance of having these skills. I joined a virology lab and it took me a year to speak the same language. What is the quality of interactions that you might have if you don't understand the importance of defining the entry mechanism used by the virus, or the stage in its life cycle that is targeted by a drug; what type of analysis can you perform if you believe that a p-value represents the probability that you found something significant. what communication can there be if you don't understand how a gene ontology database generates p-values;

peephole, wall, black magic, even worse, boring magic. Less people would bother showing gene ontology

Ask a virologist how they feel about being grouped in the same category with a bacteriologist

My thesis is that both, the people working in experimental biology and those working in bioinformatics, lose when they ignore each other. There isn't a comfortable road leading to the intersection of both fields, but it should be encouraged from day one. The PA at every university should shout "Invest time learning what's possible". Freshmen should have to wear a sticker on the forehead. Instead, they are strongly encouraged to fit in, acquire the prejudices of their peers and try to fit in. It's scary being an outlier; working at the intersection should be the norm. One thing is what you read in the brochures of universities, another is what actually happens. Litmus test, give a bioinformatics student a pipette, or give a gigabyte-sized file to an experimentalist.

Some people have tried it and decided it wasn't for them. The main reason why a bioinformatician feels uncomfortable holding a pipette, and an experimentalist gets overwhelmed with files bigger than a gigabyte is that they didn't go through the process needed to acquire the skills, it's a psychological reason. Not everybody will want to stand at the intersection, but there is no good reason why they shouldn't be encouraged. Right now, they are not encouraged.

The way classes are taught is partially to blame, together with prejudices acquired through contact with peers. How much time is spent in curricula teaching about ways to discipline/research/interpret what is out tehre? how many are spent drilling statistical techniques that are quickly forgotten?

The names betray us (experimental computationalist). The pain experienced at the intersection stems from the wildly different mindsets that are required in each discipline. Putting them together can be frustrating. computer requires total control, interactive, always-on, perfect reproducibility; experiments messy, requires practical knowledge, special setting, time-dependent, can't learn it on a book. The nature of the ideas that must be held in our heads is very distinct.

You have to learn it live, no paper every describes what it's like to actually do the experiments, no computer guy says how hard it is to install the tools on the command line.



Nobody wakes up wanting to toil away their life for a , our wildest dreams about ground-breaking work at the frontier of knowledge dampen with time into derivative or incremental contributions. Entitlement. it's terrifying to work on problems that might fail.

the reason is not that were never encouraged to acquire the necessary skills expected to go beyond the definition of their fields, not because they tried and failed.



the ability to design and perform any experiment, and the ability to process and analyze any kind of dataset are two ridiculously useful techniques on their own, but together, they compound.

I'm not knocking either discipline, both are extremely important. I am most interested about sharing these ideas with people that are straining against limiting work descriptions and have nagging thoughts about how meaningful they find their work.

using a programming to interface with a computer makes possible any idea that you can come up with. In biology, you need to learn the techniques, what are the known techniques, and what are the cutting edge techniques.

very tempting to remain at that level of abstraction, where everything happens exactly as you command. Until we can record the position of every molecule in a cell through time, it is irresponsible.

It is not encouraged, and therefore not everybody feels entitled. It is also about entitlement. Every body wants a Nature paper, not everybody feels like they would deserve it, so they don't put in the hours required to do the hard work, and get it 5 years later. If you were drilled with the mantra that everybody in your class publishes a Nature paper in 5 years, what would you do differently.

Notthin is more sad than working on easy problems because you don't feel entitled to work on harder ones. Not trying is orders of magnitude more sad than not getting it.

Nobody will ever have the unique combination of skills that you could have in 5 years, if you put in the work. Not even yourself.

If you asked members from each field, what techniques the other field uses. You catch in subtle ways (language betrays us), when a biologist saying "we performed a clustering analysis on the data" instead of we clustered data, sounds as uninformed as saying that "HIV virus" instead of HIV.

peepholes, what we know about what goes on at the other side of the wall is laughable, or depressing, depending on your mood.

bioinformatics is a hypothesis generation tool (except for some limited cases in sequence analysis?), which is a critical part of science. If you hear the phrase: experimental validation

In bioinformatics circles, the phrase "experimental validation" is thrown around to mean the final stop of the scientific process. I tell you what to look for, and you do the experimental validation. Where the paper can get published. It's funny that in experimental circles the phrase they throw around is "data analysis". You do the data analysis, and I'll tell you what it means.

Intimate knowledge of working with data is not replaceable. Same thing as intimate knowledge of the biological system that is generating the data. How much do you think the confluency affects gene expression.

Eventually you will be interested in the functional implications of whatever you discovered. The language betrays us: we talk about validating, as if that was the end of the scientific discovery. If you think experiments don't lead to more questions, you haven't done enough experiments. If you think the details are not important, you haven't done enough experiments. Does your algorithm take into account the stages of virus entry, all the mechanisms of viral entry. How many mechanisms of viral entry are there? You mean, the virus doesn't just go in?

It'

I just attended a presentation by one of my colleagues. His figures were polished, the illustrations were clear, the story was easy to follow. But he was presenting a paper so the rate of new concepts per minute was through the roof. It is really challenging to present all this information in a short period of time in a way that the audience can understand, especially if they are not experts in your field. Every minute you spend improving your figures pays off. Every time I run across an awkward figure, I feel like I hit a speed bump and the time I spend dwelling on what it says on that long y-axis label is time spent not paying attention to what the speaker is saying.

A way to easily transition into real world interactions with people I want to meet

You can see what they are interested in at the moment, it gives you an instant conversation starter.

It enables instant access to interesting strangers

we often use celebrity as a proxy for interesting

If somebody tells me that  they wouldn't pass at the opportunity to grab a beer with Seth Godin, I know we would have enough conversation for a.

There is a kind of connection that I can make with somebody who tells me that viruses are one of the coolest things on the planet.

Making it easy for people with common interests to interact with each other in their own terms is a good thing. Who wouldn't grab a drink with an interesting stranger? Why would you prefer waiting until somebody introduced you.

I also follow a handful of authors and musicians that I love. There's no feeling like having someone you admire [retweet you].

the advice I usually give about how to give a good presentation is to tell a story, which is whatever the audience remembers. The audience always remembers something, it's your choice to decide if they remember a boring presentation or an interesting idea.

You should only present something you'd be willing to share with your friends over pizza and drinks

Twitter gets more bad press than it deserves

## Twitter lets me stay in contact with people I have met

Once you've made a connection, it is effortless to keep it alive until you get the chance to continue it in real life. Glancing at your front page from time to time

No obligation to write back.

The interaction is frictionless, they don't have to follow you back, or authorize you or anything like that.



Breakfast status updates are a thing of the past.

Twitter gets much more bad press about . What you may have heard about it is likely different from the opinions of someone who uses it. Of course there is a lot of nonsense in Twitter, but breakfast status updates are a thing of the past, besides you don't have to read them. I only check Twitter once every blue moon.



Everybody uses Twitter a different way. I use it to keep track of people that share my interests in visualization, bioinformatics, virology. I follow people that I meet, or would like to meet. Next time we are in the same town, meeting requires minimal effort. Other people use it to air their frustration in 140 character-long rants. Others tell jokes

It doesn't have to be work related
I don't use it as a news service

I read 1% of tweets from the people I follow. I read all the tweets where somebody mentions me.

We are really bad about predicting where a chance encounter might take us.



that's good enough. Let interesting strangers get in contact with you,

You can be in spectator mode.

You enter the conference room. Your fellow attendees are holding a slice of pizza with one hand, and typing on their laptops with the other. You're hoping this *attendance-required* presentation won't be like the previous one. You wish the hour you are about to invest is worth it. You skip the pizza and you sit down with a notepad in your lap.

The projector is showing the first slide: *Using Gene Expression Profiles During Early Zygotic Transcription to Characterize the Biophysical Mechanism of Evolutionary Attractors*. You are not entirely sure what that means, but you recognize a few of the words, and you are not yet ready to abandon the idea that this *could* be worth it. You still believe that every speaker has something interesting to say, and the ability to share it in a way that makes it easy to understand and remember.

> Hello, the topic of this talk is using gene expression profiles during early zygotic transcription to characterize the biophysical mechanism of evolutionary attractors.

As the speaker reads the title off the screen, you wonder if he realized that choosing such an unrememberable title would force him to read it and break eye-contact with the audience two seconds after introducing himself.

> Uhm, so, this is the outline of my talk: first we'll cover a general introduction of the topic; then we will look at some of the methods we used, the results we had; and finally, I want to end by talking about the future directions of my research.

You are two minutes in, and not any closer to understanding what the talk is about. The fact that the speaker started with an outline breaks your hopes that this presentation will be bullet-point free. Nobody reads the index before diving into a novel, they trust the author's choice of structure. A conventional outline misses the opportunity to grab the attention of the audience when it is at its peak. A memorable image would have been a better choice.

> Here you can see that our approach is equivalent to shrinking the estimated sample variance of sigma; and here we are reformulating the problem in terms of the posterior probability of omega, which is nothing more than a derived hyperparameter of the model you see here.

You realize this presentation isn't about an idea, it's about a slide deck. Instead of leaving a trail of breadcrumbs between concepts, the speaker worried about describing small patches of the forest in detail, and omitted the mental map that interconnected them. Most of the people in the room are now staring down at their laptops.

The presentation is over. You clap along with everyone else, thanking the speaker for his effort, but you know you won't be able to recall a single word in two weeks. Your notepad is empty, and once again, you wonder what would have happened if instead of a giving a presentation, the speaker had told you an interesting story.
