I just attended a presentation by one of my colleagues. His figures were polished, the illustrations were clear, the story was easy to follow. But he was presenting a paper so the rate of new concepts per minute was through the roof. It is really challenging to present all this information in a short period of time in a way that the audience can understand, especially if they are not experts in your field. Every minute you spend improving your figures pays off. Every time I run across an awkward figure, I feel like I hit a speed bump and the time I spend dwelling on what it says on that long y-axis label is time spent not paying attention to what the speaker is saying.
