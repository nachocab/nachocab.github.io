I just attended a presentation by one of my colleagues. His figures were polished, the illustrations were clear, the story was easy to follow. But he was presenting a paper so the rate of new concepts per minute was through the roof. It is really challenging to present all this information in a short period of time in a way that the audience can understand, especially if they are not experts in your field. Every minute you spend improving your figures pays off. Every time I run across an awkward figure, I feel like I hit a speed bump and the time I spend dwelling on what it says on that long y-axis label is time spent not paying attention to what the speaker is saying.


A way to easily transition into real world interactions with people I want to meet

You can see what they are interested in at the moment, it gives you an instant conversation starter.

It enables instant access to interesting strangers
- hard to reach by geography and time constraints, you don't need an introduction, it is not unpolite to message someone.

we often use celebrity as a proxy for interesting

If somebody tells me that  they wouldn't pass at the opportunity to grab a beer with Seth Godin, I know we would have enough conversation for a.

There is a kind of connection that I can make with somebody who tells me that viruses are one of the coolest things on the planet.

Making it easy for people with common interests to interact with each other in their own terms is a good thing. Who wouldn't grab a drink with an interesting stranger? Why would you prefer waiting until somebody introduced you.

I also follow a handful of authors and musicians that I love. There's no feeling like having someone you admire [retweet you].

the advice I usually give about how to give a good presentation is to tell a story, which is whatever the audience remembers. The audience always remembers something, it's your choice to decide if they remember a boring presentation or an interesting idea.

You should only present something you'd be willing to share with your friends over pizza and drinks

Twitter gets more bad press than it deserves

## Twitter lets me stay in contact with people I have met

Once you've made a connection, it is effortless to keep it alive until you get the chance to continue it in real life. Glancing at your front page from time to time

No obligation to write back.

The interaction is frictionless, they don't have to follow you back, or authorize you or anything like that.



Breakfast status updates are a thing of the past.

Twitter gets much more bad press about . What you may have heard about it is likely different from the opinions of someone who uses it. Of course there is a lot of nonsense in Twitter, but breakfast status updates are a thing of the past, besides you don't have to read them. I only check Twitter once every blue moon.



Everybody uses Twitter a different way. I use it to keep track of people that share my interests in visualization, bioinformatics, virology. I follow people that I meet, or would like to meet. Next time we are in the same town, meeting requires minimal effort. Other people use it to air their frustration in 140 character-long rants. Others tell jokes

It doesn't have to be work related
I don't use it as a news service

I read 1% of tweets from the people I follow. I read all the tweets where somebody mentions me.

We are really bad about predicting where a chance encounter might take us.



that's good enough. Let interesting strangers get in contact with you,

You can be in spectator mode.

People don't stop watching TV because they don't like a show, they change the channel.




Dear me from the future,

Since you have had much more experience at being me, I won't try to second-guess if you decided to have kids, if you accepted a six figure industry position, or if your writing got good enough to deserve a paycheck. My only advantage is that I remember better than you what it was like to be you.

##

## You never stopped asking questions

got into science because you liked learning new things about the world

## Putting yourself out there has always brought you positive things

Maybe you managed to got good enough at writing to convince enough people to pay your salary
